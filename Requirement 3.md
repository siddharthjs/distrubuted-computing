# Requirement 3 Breakdown

## Detailed Explanation

**Number Rotation**:
The concept here involves a bitwise operation. Rotating bits means moving bits to the right and taking the bits that overflow from the right side to the left. For instance, if you rotate the number `1101` one bit to the right, you'd get `1110`. The tip provided gives a formula to achieve this.

**Thread Handling**:
For each input number, the server needs to spawn 32 threads. Each thread will handle the factorization of a unique rotation of the input number. The thread number (`#X`) will determine how many bits the number will be rotated right.

**Factorization**:
Once the number is rotated appropriately, you then use the desired method (as per the assignment, trial division) to factorize the number.

## Pseudo-code:

```plaintext
Function factorize_rotated_number(K, rotation_bits):
    Rotate K by rotation_bits
    Factorize the rotated number
    Return the factors

For each input number K from the client:
    For X from 0 to 31:
        Spawn a thread to factorize_rotated_number(K, X)
```

## C Implementation:

**Shared Structures**:

```c
typedef struct {
    unsigned long number;
    unsigned long slot[10];
    char clientflag;
    char serverflag[10];
    char progress[10];
} SharedMemory;
```

**Function to factorize rotated number**:

```c
#include <pthread.h>
#include <stdio.h>
// ... other required includes ...

SharedMemory* sharedMemory;  // assuming this has been appropriately initialized

void* factorize_rotated_number(void* args) {
    unsigned long K = *((unsigned long*) args);
    int rotation_bits = *((int*) (args + sizeof(unsigned long)));
    
    unsigned long rotatedNumber = (K >> rotation_bits) | (K << (32 - rotation_bits));

    // Now, factorize 'rotatedNumber' using the trial division method
    // ... Factorization logic ...

    return NULL; // Or return the factors as required
}

int main() {
    // Initialization: shared memory, mutexes, etc.

    while (1) {
        if (sharedMemory->clientflag == 1) {
            unsigned long K = sharedMemory->number;

            for (int X = 0; X < 32; X++) {
                pthread_t tid;
                // Assuming you've structured your args to contain both K and X
                pthread_create(&tid, NULL, factorize_rotated_number, /* data to pass, e.g., the number and X */);
                pthread_detach(tid);  // or store tid if you want to join later
            }

            sharedMemory->clientflag = 0;  // reset client flag
        }
    }

    // Cleanup
    return 0;
}
```

> **Note**: The implementation provided is a broad-stroke solution. It assumes that the shared memory structure is appropriately initialized elsewhere in the program. Also, many details, like the actual factorization logic and how results are communicated back to the client, are omitted for brevity. You'll need to expand on this, handle errors, and potentially add optimizations.

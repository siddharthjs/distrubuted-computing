# Requirement 1 Breakdown

## Detailed Explanation

**Multi-threaded Server**:

The server process needs to be able to handle multiple operations concurrently. This means that multiple threads should be running in the server, each doing a specific task. In the context of this assignment, this could refer to processing multiple client requests simultaneously. For each client request, the server will launch multiple threads for factorizing the numbers.

**Single/Multi-threaded Client**:

The client process can be either single-threaded or multi-threaded. A single-threaded client would handle one operation at a time (i.e., sending a request and waiting for a response), while a multi-threaded client would be able to handle multiple operations concurrently. Given the requirements, even a single-threaded client would suffice, but making it multi-threaded could provide a more fluid user experience as it can handle user input and server responses simultaneously.

## Pseudo-code

### Server

```plaintext
Initialize shared memory structures
While server is running:
    Check if clientflag is set (indicating a new number to factorize)
    If yes:
        Get the number from shared memory
        Launch multiple threads (32 as per other requirements) to factorize the number
        Each thread factorizes the number rotated by a different number of bits
```

### Client

```plaintext
While client is running:
    Get user input (number to factorize or 'q' to quit)
    If input is a number:
        Write the number to shared memory and set clientflag
    Else if input is 'q':
        Terminate client
    Check serverflag for responses and display them
```

## C Implementation

**Shared Structures**:

```c
typedef struct {
    unsigned long number;
    unsigned long slot[10];
    char clientflag;
    char serverflag[10];
    char progress[10];
} SharedMemory;
```

### Server

```c
#include <pthread.h>
#include <stdio.h>
// ... other required includes ...

SharedMemory* sharedMemory;  // assuming this has been appropriately initialized

void* factorize_thread(void* args) {
    // ... factorization logic ...
    return NULL;
}

int main() {
    // Initialization: shared memory, mutexes, etc.

    while (1) {
        if (sharedMemory->clientflag == 1) {
            for (int i = 0; i < 32; i++) {
                pthread_t tid;
                pthread_create(&tid, NULL, factorize_thread, /* data to pass, e.g., the number */);
                pthread_detach(tid);  // or store tid if you want to join later
            }
            sharedMemory->clientflag = 0;  // reset client flag
        }
    }

    // Cleanup
    return 0;
}
```

### Client

```c
#include <stdio.h>
// ... other required includes ...

SharedMemory* sharedMemory;  // assuming this has been appropriately initialized

int main() {
    // Initialization: shared memory, etc.

    while (1) {
        printf("Enter a number (or 'q' to quit): ");
        char input[50];
        fgets(input, sizeof(input), stdin);
        if (input[0] == 'q') {
            break;
        }
        unsigned long num = strtoul(input, NULL, 10);
        sharedMemory->number = num;
        sharedMemory->clientflag = 1;

        // Checking for server response can be done here or in a separate thread
        for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
            if (sharedMemory->serverflag[i] == 1) {
                // handle and display response
                sharedMemory->serverflag[i] = 0;  // reset server flag for this slot
            }
        }
    }

    // Cleanup
    return 0;
}
```

# Requirement 2 Breakdown

## Detailed Explanation

**User Interaction**:

The client needs to consistently interface with the user, asking for input. This involves displaying a prompt, reading input, and processing that input.

**Input Verification**:

The entered input should be validated to ensure it's a 32-bit integer. If not, the user should be informed and prompted again.

**Send to Server**:

Once a valid number is provided, it should be sent to the server for processing. This involves writing the number to shared memory and setting the appropriate flags to indicate new data for the server.

**Handle Termination Input**:

If the user enters `q`, the client should gracefully terminate, ensuring no ongoing requests are abruptly cut off and resources are freed.

## Pseudo-code:

```plaintext
While true:
    Display "Enter a 32-bit integer (or 'q' to quit):"
    Read user input
    If input is 'q':
        Terminate client process
    Else:
        Convert input to integer (ensure it's 32-bit)
        Send integer to the server using shared memory
```

## C Implementation:

**Shared Structures**:

```c
typedef struct {
    unsigned long number;
    unsigned long slot[10];
    char clientflag;
    char serverflag[10];
    char progress[10];
} SharedMemory;
```

**Client**:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <limits.h>
// ... other required includes ...

SharedMemory* sharedMemory;  // assuming this has been appropriately initialized

int main() {
    // Initialization: shared memory, etc.

    while (1) {
        printf("Enter a 32-bit integer (or 'q' to quit): ");
        char input[50];
        fgets(input, sizeof(input), stdin);
        
        if (input[0] == 'q' || input[0] == 'Q') {
            break;  // Terminate client process
        }

        unsigned long num = strtoul(input, NULL, 10);

        // Verify it's a 32-bit number (considering unsigned range for simplicity)
        if (num > UINT_MAX) {
            printf("Please enter a valid 32-bit number.\n");
            continue;  // Re-prompt the user
        }

        sharedMemory->number = num;
        sharedMemory->clientflag = 1;  // Signal the server

        // You might want to add logic to check for server responses or handle other operations.
    }

    // Cleanup
    return 0;
}
```

> Remember, the implementation provided assumes that the shared memory structure is appropriately initialized elsewhere in the program. Also, this is a simplified version, and in a real-world scenario, you'd need to include error checks, handle edge cases, and possibly add more user-friendly features.
